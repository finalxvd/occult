# Testing Occult
Testing of the Occult language
## Speed
Using the `time` command on *nix we can time the time it takes to execute the fibonacci sequence

```
Occult:
fib(45) = 1134903170
real	0m5.021s
user	0m5.012s
sys	0m0.001s

C++:
fib(45) = 1134903170
real	0m1.211s
user	0m1.208s
sys	0m0.001s

Python:
fib(45) = 1134903170

real	1m23.780s
user	1m23.608s
sys	0m0.000s
```
